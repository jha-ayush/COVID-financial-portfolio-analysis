# Financial Portfolio Analysis
> [Deployment site](https://www.google.com "Project 01")

We're building a portfolio analyzer tear sheet to analyze a financial portfolio of specific investment stocks & ETFs from FY 2017-2022 to assess the impact of COVID during and post shutdown. We are going to compare the data against the S&P500 index.

Tickers used for portfolio analysis:
- `AMZN` - Amazon.com, Inc.
- `AMT` - American Tower Corp
- `XOM` - Exxon Mobil Corp
- `XLE` - Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund
- `IYR` - iShares US Real Estate ETF
- `RTH` - VanEck Retail ETF
- `SPY` - S&P500 ETF used for benchmarking

### Project Description/Outline
We will use [polygon.io](https://polygon.io/ "Polygon.io") to make [RESTful API](https://polygon.io/docs/stocks/getting-started "Polygon Stocks API Docs") calls using their [Starter paywall](https://polygon.io/pricing "Polygon pricing") with the following features below:

- <sub>$29/month</sub>
- <sub>15-minute delayed data</sub>
- <sub>5 years max historical data</sub>
- <sub>100% market coverage</sub>

General to dos:
- pull data from API's
- calculate returns
- variance
- covariance
- beta
- mean
- summary statistics
- Montecarlo simulations
- questionary with sql
- dashboard
- Web app deployment
