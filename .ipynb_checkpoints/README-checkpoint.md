We built a portfolio analyzer tear sheet to view financial market behaviors of specific investment stocks & ETFs from FY 2017-2022 to assess the impacts of pre-COVID and post-COVID timelines. We are going to compare the data against the S&P500 index.

Tickers used for portfolio analysis:
- `AMZN` - Amazon.com, Inc.
- `AMT` - American Tower Corp
- `XOM` - Exxon Mobil Corp
- `XLE` - Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF Fund
- `IYR` - iShares US Real Estate ETF
- `RTH` - VanEck Retail ETF
- `SPY` - S&P500 ETF used for benchmarking
