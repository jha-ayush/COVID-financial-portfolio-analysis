# Executive summary

## Title: Financial Portfolio Analyzer

### The Core
The core of our project is essentially a portfolio analyzer that analyzes the returns of three different sectors of stocks/ETFs (Tech, Real Estate, Energy) across three different time periods (pre-pandemic, pandemic, post-pandemic), in order to analyze which sector(s) would have been the best to invest in for each time period(s). Of the three sectors chosen, six assets were chosen to track. The six assets include sector leading individual stocks (chosen by market cap and market power), and sector wide broad based ETFs (chosen by market cap and market power). Also, selected was a proxy ETF for the S&P 500 as a benchmark.

## Key Features:
The CLI: answers a variety of investment questions for users.

Price/Returns Data: users can choose any ticker from a wide range of indexes and obtain the price/returns data for that ticker.

Statistics/Visualizations/Tearsheets: users can easily analyze and visualize tickers in the form of a multitude of statistics, graphs and pyfolio tearsheets.

Email Functionality: users can easily contact the platform founders right from the site!

## Target Audience: 
Our Financial Portfolio Analyzer is designed for the growing pool of starting/amateur traders and investors who need an acessible platform to analyze assets and make investment decisions.

*Post-pandemic*:
- start_date = 2022-03-01
- end_date = 2022-11-01


### Limitations and Future Expectations
We aim to give users the best experience possible on our streamlit platform, so we have decided to include a wide variety of features that have taken more time to implement than we initially anticipated. Our streamlit platform should be available to users in the upcoming weeks. We appreciate your patience, and in the meantime, enjoy our CLI!
